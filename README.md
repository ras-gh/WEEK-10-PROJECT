# WEEK-10-PROJECT
Week 10 Project for Software Development Bootcamp

The brief was to create an app which could read and manipulate a database using python coding.
I decided to create a simple database from scratch in MySQL Workbench.
The table in the database was then populated with dummy data.
I decided to create a simple GUI using tkinter, which is a module built in to Python
and enables the creation of a visual display window independent of any web browser.
The GUI was then opulated with various widgets which could either be buttons
to perform actions, text fields to hold data, labels and combo boxes to allow
the user to make selections from a list.

The Python program first loads a module to connect to the MySQL database,
then displays the GUI and confirms whether the connection is successful.
The GUI enables the user to view all records contained in the database.
A record can be searched for according to its ID, updated or deleted.
New records can also be added.
In addition, several customised searches are available, including search by genre,
search by Film rating certificate, or search by year of release.
